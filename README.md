## PROBLEM STATEMENT
Tissue Poa company, a Kenyan based tissue manufacturing brand is considering launching a new tissue brand in the market. After 40 years of successfully dominating the tissue market, the brand is facing numerous challenges key amongst them being the presence of new entrants in the market who employ Human-Centred Design (HCD) for all their tissue product categories. 

To keep up with current trends and maintain their market share, Tissue Poa company has come up with a new tissue category dubbed the 150 sheet tissue, whose target market are self-employed women who are fully responsible for household shopping. After a successful, Design Thinking process, Tissue Poa company foresees a good uptake of this product in the market hence they are ready for launching.

Ground View Analytics, was tasked with a BTL- marketing, direct sales strategy with a target of selling 7000 bales to General Trade outlets in Nairobi South Region for a one-month period on behalf of Tissue Poa company	As the Data Analyst for GV Analytics, responsible for Data Processing, Data Analysis and Report writing, you have received the raw data  from the data processing team and you are required to do anayze it and give a report to the manager so thay they know if they are in the right path.

## ANALYSIS
 The data provided by the processing team was rich and insightful, however I was interested in learning the following:
 
 * What regions and sub regions had the highest bale revenues?
 * What was the change in the restock revenue in each region?
 * How does the original bales and restock bales compare per region?
 * Which trade category stocks the most tissues?

I decided to use Power Bi for my analysis and used its pillars i.e **_DAX Calculation_**, **_Data Transformation_** and **_Data Visualization_**
